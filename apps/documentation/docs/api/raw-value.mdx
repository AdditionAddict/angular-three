There are occasions where we want to declaratively assign a single value to a property on a parent element, we can use
`<ngt-value>` Custom Element tag.

```html
<!-- this saves us the trouble of getting access to the PointLight instance and assign 0.0001 to light.shadow.bias -->
<ngt-point-light>
    <!-- with this, we can declaratively assign a value to shadow.bias; under an ngIf or something similar -->
    <ngt-value [rawValue]="0.0001" attach="shadow.bias" />
</ngt-point-light>
```
