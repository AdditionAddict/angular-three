`NgtPush` is similar to Angular's `AsyncPipe`. The difference is `NgtPush` works with a CD-detached environment like
NGT.

```html
<!-- might not work because Change Detection doesn't run -->
<ngt-box-geometry *args="args$ | async" />
<!-- ensures Change Detection triggers on changes -->
<ngt-box-geometry *args="args$ | ngtPush" />
```

### Default Value

`NgtPush` accepts a default value for the first emission.

```html
<!-- make a box of [2, 2, 2] by default -->
<ngt-box-geometry *args="args$ | ngtPush: [2, 2, 2]" />
```
