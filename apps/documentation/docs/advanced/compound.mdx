Compound Component is a component that wraps at least one THREE.js entity in its template and all Inputs will be forwarded to that THREE.js entity.

There are two steps to create a Compound component

-   Ensure that NGT Custom Renderer recognizes the Compound Component's selector as a `compound`. We can use `[compoundPrefixes]` Input on `<ngt-canvas>` to configure this
-   Add `ngtCompound` attribute on the THREE.js entity that we want our Compound Component to wrap

Suppose we have the following template

```html
<ngt-mesh>
    <ngt-box-geometry *args="args" />
    <ngt-mesh-basic-material />
</ngt-mesh>

<ngt-mesh>
    <ngt-box-geometry *args="argsTwo" />
    <ngt-mesh-standard-material />
</ngt-mesh>
```

We notice that we keep using `<ngt-mesh>` and `<ngt-box-geometry>`. This is a good candidate to make into a Compound Component. In this case,
we'll make a `Box` component.

```ts
extend({ Mesh, BoxGeometry });

@Component({
    selector: 'tutorial-box',
    standalone: true,
    template: `
        <ngt-mesh ngtCompound [ref]="boxRef">
            <ngt-box-geometry *args="boxArgs" />
            <ng-content />
        </ngt-mesh>
    `,
    imports: [NgtArgs],
})
export class Box {
    @Input() boxRef = injectNgtRef<Mesh>();
    @Input() boxArgs: ConstructorParameters<typeof BoxGeometry> = [1, 1, 1];
}

@Component({
    template: `<ngt-canvas [compoundPrefixes]="['tutorial']" />`,
})
export class SomeFeature {}
```

-   We use `<ngt-mesh>` and `<ngt-box-geometry>` with `<ng-content>`. This allows the consumers to pass in any Material, or other objects as children to our `<ngt-mesh>`

    -   We use `ngtCompound` on the `<ngt-mesh>`. This lets NGT Custom Renderer knows that `Box` component will forward its Inputs to `<ngt-mesh>`
        :::note

        Inputs that are defined like `boxRef` and `boxArgs` will **not** get forwarded.

        :::

-   We `extend({Mesh, BoxGeometry})` to ensure that NGT Custom Renderer knows about `Mesh` and `BoxGeometry` if they consume `Box` component
-   We let the NGT Custom Renderer knows that our `Box` component is a Compound Component by providing `['tutorial']` to `compoundPrefixes`

Now that we have `Box`, we can consume it like following

```html
<tutorial-box>
    <ngt-mesh-basic-material />
</tutorial-box>

<tutorial-box [position]="[2, 2, 2]">
    <ngt-mesh-standard-material />
</tutorial-box>

<tutorial-box [position]="[-2, -2, -2]">
    <ngt-mesh-standard-material />
    <ngt-mesh>
        <ngt-plane-geometry />
    </ngt-mesh>
</tutorial-box>
```
