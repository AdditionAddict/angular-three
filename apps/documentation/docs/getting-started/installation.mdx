## Automatic

For Angular CLI projects, run the following command:

```shell
ng add angular-three
```

For [Nx](https://nx.dev) users, run the following commands:

```shell
npm i angular-three
npx nx g angular-three:init
```

The generator (schematic) does the following:

-   Installs `three`, `@types/three`, and `angular-three` (in the case of Angular CLI)
-   Turns on `skipLibCheck: true`

## Manual

```shell
npm i angular-three three
npm i -D @types/three
```

Next, open `tsconfig.json` (or `tsconfig.base.json` in an Nx Workspace) and add `skipLibCheck: true` to `compilerOptions`
