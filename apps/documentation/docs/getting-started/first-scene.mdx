This tutorial will help us setup our first NGT scene and introduce us to some of its core concepts.

:::note

-   We are using Inline Template syntax for this tutorial
-   We will put everything in `app.component.ts` for simplicity

## Create a root component for our Scene graph

Let's start by creating a Component as the root of our Scene graph. We'll put the component in `app.component.ts` for now

```ts title="app.component.ts"
import { Component, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    standalone: true,
    template: ``,
    schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
export class SceneGraph {}

@Component({
    /*...*/
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

-   The `template` is intentionally left empty, we'll fill it out later.
-   The `selector` is intentionally left out because we'll not render our `SceneGraph` component on the template.
-   `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` is required because Angular does not support custom schemas so our Custom Elements won't work without it.

## Set up the Canvas

The scene graph in NGT starts with `<ngt-canvas>`. Let's render `<ngt-canvas>` on our `app.component.ts` template.
Make sure to import `NgtCanvas` from `angular-three`

```ts title="app.component.ts"
import { Component, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
// highlight-next-line
import { NgtCanvas } from 'angular-three';

@Component({
    /*...*/
})
export class SceneGraph {}

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    standalone: true,
    // highlight-start
    template: `<ngt-canvas [sceneGraph]="SceneGraph" />`,
    imports: [NgtCanvas],
    // highlight-end
})
export class AppComponent {
    // highlight-next-line
    readonly SceneGraph = SceneGraph;
}
```

-   `<ngt-canvas>` has a **required** input `[sceneGraph]` which accepts a Component class. We pass our `SceneGraph` component into that input.

`ngt-canvas` sets up the following:

-   A `WebGLRenderer`, a default `Scene`, and a default `PerspectiveCamera`
-   A render loop that renders our scene evere frame outside of Angular Zone
-   A `window:resize` listener that updates our Renderer and Camera when the viewport is resized

`ngt-canvas` renders the `SceneGraph` input in a _detached_ environment from Angular Change Detection. It also provides the custom Angular Renderer
to render THREE.js entities instead of DOM elements.

Next, we'll set some basic styles in `styles.css`

```css title="style.css"
html,
body {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0;
}
```

:::tip

`ngt-canvas` is designed to fit the parent container so we can control our 3D scene by adjusting the parent's dimensions.

```html
<div class="canvas-container">
    <ngt-canvas [sceneGraph]="..." />
</div>
```
